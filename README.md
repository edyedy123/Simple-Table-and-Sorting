# Simple Table 

In this assignment I created a Simple Table with records. I added the search and sort functionality using quick sort and a simple linear search. 
I also used hashing algorithms to store sensitive information into the table.

## What I learned
- I learned about efficiency and O(n) notation.
- Explored many sorting methods
- Learned about hashing and securing methods
